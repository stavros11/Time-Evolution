"""Methods for VMC optimization of Clock using exact calculations.

Exact calculations = VMC with infinite samples.

Requires the full wavefunction at each time step and uses all states to
calculate expectation values deterministically.
(exponentially expensive sum - no sampling!)
Works with any model as it uses the full Hamiltonian matrix for the calculation.
"""
# Reminder: This script had a `normalized_clock` method implemented which was
# calculating a Clock derived from the projected Schrodinger's equation.
# This was removed because of change of the project's focus. If you need to
# recover it use the `master_0919patch` branch.
