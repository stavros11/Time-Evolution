  """Optimizes the Clock Hamiltonian for a machine globally.

  Globally means that all time steps are optimized in a single optimziation
  step.

  Args:
    machine: Machine object to optimize.
    grad_func: Method that calculates gradients.
      See typing for the type of arguments and returns.
      Should be one of the gradient calculation methods defined unter`energy`
      with `ham` and the rest arguments specified.
    sampler: Sampler to use for calculating `configs` and `times` samples.
      If None, deterministic calculation mode is assumed.
    exact_state: Exact state evolution with shape (T + 1, 2^N).
    detenergy_func: Function that calculates deterministic energy.
      This is relevant only for the sampling case.
    n_message: Every how many epochs to print messages during optimization.
      If `None` no messages are printed.
    index_to_update: If this is not `None` then the gradient is masked so
      that only this index is updated.

  Returns:
    history: Dictionary with the history of quantities we track during training.
      See definition of `history` in method for a list of tracked quantities.
    machine: Machine object after its optimization is completed.
